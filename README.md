## Objectives
- Manage change in a project.
- Collaborate over time and space.
- Fork a repository.
- Clone a repository
- Synchronize repositories locally.
- Synchronize repositories remotely.


## Prerequisites
- Complete [Git Basics](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/git-basics)

## Overview 

Continuing in our project, [Git Basics](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/git-basics) we are going to use Github to manage a project.

Each person that is working in project will be working on their own computer. They will have a local copy of the project and will be using Git to manage change.
The challenge is to be able to manage change across all the local copies of a project distributed over multiple computers!

In order to do this we will create a repository on github that will be the definitive version of the project. This "repo" will live in a github account owned by the company or project team. This is the *project owner's repo*.

And each person/developer that would like to contribute their changes to the project will also have a github account. As we'll see we **fork** or copy the repo from the project owner's github account into our github account.

## Forking a Repository.

Given a project repository in an account owned by the project team we will create create a copy or **fork the repo**.
