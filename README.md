## Objectives
- Manage change in a project.
- Collaborate over time and space.
- Fork a repository.
- Clone a repository
- Synchronize repositories locally.
- Synchronize repositories remotely.


## Prerequisites
- [Git Basics](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/git-basics)

## Overview

Continuing with what we started [Git Basics](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/git-basics) we are going to use Github
to manage our project.

## Demo: Linking with GitHub

So we have a local repository, watch as I create a GitHub repository. Why
GitHub? So we can backup our code online. It also provides us with a useful
graphical interface and useful collaboration features.

Now create your own GitHub repository.

## Lab: More Pushing

The last time we saw Ned Stark we had just written his fate.  Below his story
write the beggining of another character's story.  For instance:


> Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to
> being, and let me assure you he will ___DEFINITELY NOT DIE!___


## Demo: Adding to Your Story

Watch as I `fork` and `clone` one of your repos and make an addition by
creating a `pull request`.

## Lab: Adding to Other's Stories

Working with a partner follow my example and take turns adding to one another's
stories. Accept each other's pull requests.  After you've each gone once stop.

## Pulling: Updating Your Local

Each of you should now have updated code on GitHub, but your local Git repo
will be behind.  We need to get the latest code off of GitHub.  We can do this
by pulling the changes that we merged.  The command to do this is:

`git pull origin master`

This get the latest copy of our code off of the master branch of our original
repository.
